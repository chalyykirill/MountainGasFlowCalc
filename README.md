# Numerical Simulation of the "Dzuarikau-Tskhinval" High-Altitude Gas Pipeline
## Project Description
This project is dedicated to the numerical simulation of major gas pipelines using numerical methods for solving differential equations in thermodynamics. Specifically, the project employs the Euler's broken line method (also known as the piecewise linear method) to model the flow dynamics within the highest altitude gas pipeline in the world, the "Dzuarikau-Tskhinval" pipeline.

The main focus of this repository is to provide a framework for predicting the steady-state operation modes of high-altitude gas pipelines, which are subject to unique environmental challenges due to their elevation and geographical location. By applying advanced numerical methods to real-world engineering problems, this project aims to enhance the understanding and management of gas flow in complex pipeline systems.

## Features
- Implementation of the Euler's broken line method for solving differential equations.
- Simulation of thermodynamic processes within a high-altitude pipeline environment.
- Analysis of the "Dzuarikau-Tskhinval" gas pipeline, providing insights into its operational challenges and behaviors.
## Tools and Technologies
